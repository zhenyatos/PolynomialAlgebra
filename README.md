# PolynomialAlgebra
> Console calculator with support of the Integers, Rationals, Modular arithmetic, as well as the Polynomials over these types

## Requirements
- GCC 7.3.0 (C++ 11)
- CMake

## Build
To compile the project, run the following command in the root folder:

`cmake --build build --config Release --target all -j`

This should generate *palgebra* executable inside `build` folder. Now you can run it and move to the next steps.

## Usage
Usage is fairly intuitive, so I have decided to include some examples and that's it.

### Basic types arithmetic

### Polynomials arithmetic
